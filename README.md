# remote server commands
Set up commands for linode using ubuntu 18.04.

I have set up a few Linode servers, not using scripts, and had followed the set up from [Corey Schafer's Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_kQheCnds&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=13). Specifically, the video that I linked to. 

I also have had to set up MongoDB a couple of times now, which has always had some quirks, but the commands for that seem to work well. 

I made the list as a quick reference for myself because I didn't want to miss steps. However, I'm not sure how useful they will be to someone else. 

This won't only work on Linode, that is just the provider I was using. No affiliation or endorsement.
