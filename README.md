Set up commands for linode

I have set up a few Linode servers, not using scripts, and had followed the set up from [Corey Schafer's Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_kQheCnds&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=13).

I made the list as a quick reference because I didn't want to miss steps. The setup goes from right after the creation of the node to setting up firewall. It does not have commands for setting up web servers or creating git repo.
